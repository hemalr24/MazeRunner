## How to run this software?

To build the program, simply package it with Maven:

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % mvn -q clean package 
```

### Provided version (starter code)

The starter code assumes the maze file name is the first argument. 

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % java -jar target/mazerunner.jar ./examples/small.maz.txt
** Starting Maze Runner
**** Reading the maze from file ./examples/small.maz.txt
WALL WALL WALL WALL WALL WALL WALL WALL WALL WALL WALL 
WALL PASS PASS PASS PASS PASS PASS PASS PASS PASS WALL

**** Computing path
PATH NOT COMPUTED
** End of MazeRunner
```

When called on a non-existing file. it prints an error message

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % java -jar target/mazerunner.jar ./examples/small.maz.txtd
** Starting Maze Runner
**** Reading the maze from file ./examples/small.maz.txtd
/!\ An error has occured /!\
**** Computing path
PATH NOT COMPUTED
** End of MazeRunner
```

### Delivered version

#### Command line arguments

The delivered program at the end of this assignment should use the following flags:

- `-i MAZE_FILE`: specifies the filename to be used;
- `-p PATH_SEQUENCE`: activates the path verification mode to validate that PATH_SEQUENCE is correct for the maze

If you are also delivering the bonus, your program will react to a third flag:

- `-method {tremaux, righthand}`: specifies which path computation method to use. (default is right hand)

#### Examples

When no logs are activated, the programs only print the computed path on the standard output.

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % java -jar target/mazerunner.jar -i ./examples/straight.maz.txt
4F
mosser@azrael A1-Template %
```

If a given path is correct, the program prints the message `correct path` on the standard output.

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % java -jar target/mazerunner.jar -i ./examples/straight.maz.txt -p 4F
correct path
mosser@azrael A1-Template %
```

If a given path is incorrect, the program prints the message `incorrect path` on the standard output.

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % java -jar target/mazerunner.jar -i ./examples/straight.maz.txt -p 3F
incorrect path
mosser@azrael A1-Template %
```
